        My name is Yiğit Günsür Elmacıoğlu. If you don't speak turkish, don't spend time trying to pronounce, it's a bit hard :relaxed: Just "Yeet" is fine!

        I’m a senior mechanical engineering and physics double major undergraduate student at Boğaziçi University, a highly prestigious school with most students scoring 0.1% on the nationwide exam. With a 3.91 GPA, I am currently the top student in the mechanical engineering department. My systematic and aesthetic problem-solving abilities form a substantial part of my personality, acquired after years of observation of 2 architects <sup><i><b>mom&sister</b></i></sup> and a computer engineer <sup><i><b>father</b></i></sup>, my life-long mentors.

          I built this website primarily for Ph.D. applications. Therefore, the content is mostly on my academic background, but I deliberately used informal language to be able to give an opinion on my personality. I hope I did a good job on explaining my projects without boring you! For more details on a specific project, you can check the publication, if there is any, or contact me.

      <h2>Brief personal background...</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Growing up with 2 architects, I believe I have obtained a good aesthetic vision and crafting skills. I care a lot about the visual quality of my projects as much as the content. Maybe that's why I made this website :smile: As a person who loves watching documentaries, I think visual representations significantly facilitate learning, even the most difficult concepts.

          I love cycling. Even in Istanbul, a very hilly city, I travel mostly on my bike. Recently, I converted my bike to an e-bike, and I think it is the best way of transport in a very crowded city, but not the safest for sure. Also, in my free time, I play acoustic and electro guitar (depending on my mood). In high school, I was in a band. If I ever have the chance again, I want to play with others.

          In primary school, I was a swimmer. For 7 years, I spent a lot of time in the pool, training. I believe that training with a professional coach at a young age gives you a certain understanding of respect and demureness. In addition, when swimming 5 km per training session, you have so much time to think. Maybe, that's why I like brainstorming by myself and also why I sometimes overthink.
