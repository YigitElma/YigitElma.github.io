              <li> <b>b) </b> Maybe you found it while stalking me, then no problem :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
              <li> <b>c) </b> Or, fortunately, you are one of the professors I wish to pursue Ph.D./Master with. I am honored to be able to get your attention. Hope this website can give you a better understanding of me :relaxed:

            As you probably see on the left side (if you are on desktop), I'm Yiğit Günsür Elmacıoğlu. If you don't speak turkish, don't spend time trying to pronounce, it's a bit hard :relaxed: Just "Yee-it" is fine!

            I’m a senior mechanical engineering and physics double major undergraduate student at Boğaziçi University, a highly prestigious school with most students scoring 0.1% on the nationwide exam. With a 3.90 GPA, I am currently the top student in the mechanical engineering department. My systematic and aesthetic problem-solving abilities form a substantial part of my personality, acquired after years of observation of 2 architects<sup><i><b>mom&sister</b></i></sup> and a computer engineer<sup><i><b>father</b></i></sup>, my life-long mentors.

            <p align="justify">
            By growing up with 2 architects, I believe I have obtained a good aesthetic vision and I care a lot about the visual quality of my projects as much as the content. Maybe that's why I made this website :smile: Furthermore, getting accustomed to architectural drawings at a young age, made me like and be good at geometry, sometimes I solve geometry problems as a hobby.

            I love riding a bike. Even in Istanbul which is a very hilly city, by the way, I travel mostly on my e-bike, I know it's cheating but after 2 years of effort, I needed one. Also, in my free time, I play acoustic and electro guitar (depending on my mood). In high school, I was in a band, and if I'll ever have the chance again, I want to play with others.

            In primary school, I was a swimmer. For 7 years, I spent a lot of time in the pool, training. I believe at a young age, training with a professional coach gives you a certain understanding of respect and demureness. In addition, when swimming 5 km per single training session, you have soo.. much time to think. Maybe, that's why I like brainstorming by myself.
