Since you are here...
------
I assume you are one of my friends who I forced to check this website, if so thank you :smile:

Maybe you found it while stalking me, then no problem :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Or, fortunately, you are one of the professors I wish to pursue Ph.D./Master with. I am honored to be able to get your attention. Hope this website can give you a better understanding of me :relaxed:

Anyway, let's get to the point!
------
As you probably see on the left side, I'm Yigit Gunsur Elmacioglu. If you don't speak turkish, don't spend time trying to pronounce, it's a bit hard:relaxed: Just "Yee-it" is fine!

I’m a senior mechanical engineering and physics double major undergraduate student at Boğaziçi University which is a highly prestigious school with most of its students placed in 0.1% in the nationwide exam. With a 3.90 GPA, I am currently the top student in the mechanical engineering department. My systematic and aesthetic problem-solving abilities are the key factors of my success which are acquired after years of observation of 2 architects <sup>***mom&sister***</sup> and a computer engineer <sup>***father***</sup>, my life-long mentors. 

The content here will definitely change later on. Stay tuned for more!

None academic stuff...
------
By growing up with 2 architects, I believe I have obtained a good aesthetic vision and I care a lot about the visual quality of my projects as much as the content. Maybe that's why I am good at geometry, sometimes I solve geometry problems as a hobby, and why I made this website :smile:. 

Also, I love riding a bike. Even in Istanbul which is a very hilly city, by the way, I travel mostly on my e-bike, I know it's cheating but after 2 years of effort, I needed one.
