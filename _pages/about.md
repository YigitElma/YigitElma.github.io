Since you are here...

<div align="justify">

<b>a -</b> I assume you are one of my friends who I forced to check this website, if so thank you :smile:
<br />
<b>b -</b> Maybe you found it while stalking me, then no problem :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
<br />
<b>c -</b> Or, fortunately, you are one of the professors I wish to pursue Ph.D./Master with. I am honored to be able to get your attention. Hope this website can give you a better understanding of me :relaxed:
</div>

Anyway, let's get to the point!

As you probably see on the left side (if you are on desktop), I'm Yiğit Günsür Elmacıoğlu. If you don't speak turkish, don't spend time trying to pronounce, it's a bit hard :relaxed: Just "Yee-it" is fine!

I’m a senior mechanical engineering and physics double major undergraduate student at Boğaziçi University which is a highly prestigious school with most of its students placed in 0.1% in the nationwide exam. With a 3.90 GPA, I am currently the top student in the mechanical engineering department. My systematic and aesthetic problem-solving abilities are the key factors of my success which are acquired after years of observation of 2 architects <sup><i><b>mom&sister</b></i></sup> and a computer engineer <sup><i><b>father</b></i></sup>, my life-long mentors. 

The content here will definitely change later on. Stay tuned for more!

None academic stuff...

By growing up with 2 architects, I believe I have obtained a good aesthetic vision and I care a lot about the visual quality of my projects as much as the content. Maybe that's why I made this website :smile: Furthermore, getting accustomed to architectural drawings at a young age, made me like and be good at geometry, sometimes I solve geometry problems as a hobby.

I love riding a bike. Even in Istanbul which is a very hilly city, by the way, I travel mostly on my e-bike, I know it's cheating but after 2 years of effort, I needed one. Also, in my free time, I play acoustic and electro guitar (depending on my mood). In high school, I was in a band, and if I'll ever have the chance again, I want to play with others.

In primary school, I was a swimmer. For 7 years, I spent a lot of time in the pool, training. I believe at a young age, training with a professional coach gives you a certain understanding of respect and demureness. In addition, when swimming 5 km per single training session, you have soo.. much time to think. Maybe, that's why I like brainstorming by myself.
