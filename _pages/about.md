Since you are here...
------
I assume you are one of my friends who I forced to check this website, if so thank you :smile:

Maybe you found it while stalking me, then no problem :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Or, fortunately, you are one the professors I wish pursuing PHD/Masters with. I am honored to be able to get your attention. Hope this website can give you a better understanding of me :relaxed:

Anyway, let's get to the point!
------
As you probably see on the left side, I'm Yigit Gunsur Elmacioglu. If you don't speak turkish, don't spend time trying to pronounce, it's a bit hard:relaxed: Just "Yi-it" is fine!

The content here will definitely change later on. Stay tuned for more!

None academic stuff...
------
I love sports and music. Playing guitar is one of my hobbies and I use and learn some skills to improve the setup in home, as you will see in my projects.
