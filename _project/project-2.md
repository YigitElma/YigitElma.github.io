There are many types of propulsion systems used in space applications. The most known category is liquid fueled high thrust rocket engines which are used during the ascend phase of the mission. Generally, these engines fire around 100-120 seconds. Another category is electrified propulsion which uses ionized Xenon gas to produce thrust
