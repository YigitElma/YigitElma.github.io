When I was 10, as birthday present, I asked for ***"Guitar Hero"*** which was a popular game at the time. My mom said "I can buy you an actual guitar instead!". A bit cliche -for my generation- but this is how I started playing electro guitar. 

Today, I may not be a virtuoso but I have a talent which most guitars players don't... I am an engineer ! :smile:

As you know, sound is transported in wave form, for electro guitar this is the alternating electrical signal which is induced by the vibration of strings in the electromagnetic coils on the guitar, pick-ups. Normally these are sinusoidal waves, however, one can change the shape to get different tones. Although the actual notes itself does not change, the distinct features of the sound may be extremely different.

You may be familiar with terms capacitor, transistor and op-amp from your physics or circuit courses. Aranging those components can result in an intended effect on the sound such as compression, distortion, overdrive etc...
